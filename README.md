# bamazon

Bamazon! The first (and possibly only) command line shopping app.

Check out the inventory, where a number of items will be listed. These items can be added to by use of the manager file, which is just another node command away.

Once you see something you like, select your item and input how many you would like to purchase. You will then be notified if there are enough in stock to meet your needs and the total price of your purchase. 




This was created as an exercise implementing Node.js and basic javascript logic interactions with MySql and Workbench.
(You will need a local MySQL database for the program to run as intended.)
